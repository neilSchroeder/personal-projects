# Flou

This python plays the game [flou](https://gameforge.com/en-US/littlegames/flou/#) from a given board. This code serves as a solution to this 2 kyu [prompt on codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a93754d0025e98fde000048/train/python).

## Notes

This was particularly challenging to solve in the time constraint given my approach. I managed to just squeak in under the wire using line_profiler and kernprof to optimize the code.
