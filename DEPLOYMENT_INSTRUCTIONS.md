# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## ‚úÖ What We've Done

1. **Installed SvelteKit Static Adapter** - Converts your SvelteKit app to static files
2. **Configured Static Generation** - Updated `svelte.config.js` for GitHub Pages
3. **Created GitHub Actions Workflow** - Automated deployment on push
4. **Added Required Files** - `.nojekyll`, favicon, layout configuration
5. **Tested Build Process** - Confirmed static generation works

## üöÄ Next Steps to Go Live

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. **Go to Your Repository on GitHub**
   - Navigate to: `https://github.com/neilSchroeder/personal-projects`

2. **Access Repository Settings**
   - Click the "Settings" tab in your repository
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar

3. **Configure Pages Source**
   - Under "Build and deployment"
   - Set **Source** to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
   - This tells GitHub to use our workflow file

### Step 2: Push Your Changes

```bash
# Add all the new files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment with SvelteKit static adapter"

# Push to trigger the deployment
git push origin master
```

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment

1. **Check Actions Tab**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
   - You should see the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running

2. **Wait for Completion**
   - The workflow will take 2-3 minutes to complete
   - You'll see green checkmarks when successful

3. **Access Your Live Site**
   - Your game will be available at: `https://neilSchroeder.github.io/personal-projects/`

## üéÆ Current Status

**Frontend**: ‚úÖ Ready for static deployment
- SvelteKit configured for static generation
- GitHub Actions workflow created
- Build process tested and working

**Backend**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Currently Non-Functional in Static Version**

The static version will deploy successfully, but the game functionality is currently limited because:

- API calls to the FastAPI backend won't work (backend not included in static build)
- Game logic, puzzle generation, and hints are still server-side
- You'll see the UI but won't be able to play the game

## üîß Next Phase: Port Game Logic to Frontend

To make the game fully functional on GitHub Pages, we need to port the Python game logic to JavaScript/TypeScript. This includes:

### Core Components to Port:

1. **TangoBoardSolver** (`backend/app/services/game_service.py`)
   - Constraint optimization algorithms
   - Puzzle validation logic  
   - Hint generation system

2. **Game Models** (`backend/app/models/game_models.py`)
   - PieceType enum
   - ConstraintType enum
   - GameState interface

3. **Puzzle Generation**
   - Complete solution generation
   - Strategic constraint placement
   - Redundancy elimination

### Implementation Strategy:

1. **Create Frontend Game Logic Directory**
   ```
   frontend/src/lib/game/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TangoBoardSolver.ts
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GameService.ts
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.ts
   ```

2. **Port Core Algorithms**
   - Convert Python classes to TypeScript
   - Maintain the same logical structure
   - Preserve optimization algorithms

3. **Replace API Calls**
   - Remove fetch calls to backend
   - Use local game service instead
   - Store leaderboard in localStorage

4. **Test Functionality**
   - Ensure puzzle generation works
   - Verify hint system functions
   - Test constraint optimization

## üéØ Expected Timeline

- **Immediate**: Static site deployment (UI only) - 5 minutes
- **Phase 1**: Port basic game logic - 2-3 hours
- **Phase 2**: Port advanced features (hints, optimization) - 4-6 hours
- **Phase 3**: Testing and refinement - 1-2 hours

## üåê Live URL Preview

Once deployed, your game will be accessible at:
**https://neilSchroeder.github.io/personal-projects/**

The URL structure follows GitHub Pages convention:
- `neilSchroeder` - Your GitHub username
- `personal-projects` - Your repository name

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails:

1. **Check Actions Tab** - Look for error messages in the workflow
2. **Verify File Paths** - Ensure the workflow paths match your structure
3. **Check Branch Name** - Workflow triggers on 'main' or 'master'
4. **Permissions** - Ensure GitHub Actions has permissions to deploy

### Common Issues:

- **404 Error**: Check that Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- **Build Fails**: Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- **Assets Missing**: Ensure favicon and static files exist

## üìû Ready to Deploy?

Execute these commands to go live:

```bash
cd /home/nschroed/Documents/personal-projects/tango
git add .
git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment for Tango puzzle game"
git push origin master
```

Then follow the repository settings steps above!

Would you like me to help with the next phase of porting the game logic to make it fully functional?
