This is a script for making a homepage in php. 

To use this script simply download the index and style files into a visible folder (mine is called public_html).

Make a folder called resources and put the style file into it.

Run the following command `find . -type d -exec cp -f index.php {} \;` to copy index.php into all subdirectories recursively.
