# Breit-Wigner conv. Crystal-ball Fitter

This is a fairly quick python feature that will fit some input data (x,y) to a breit-wigner colvoluted with a crystal ball.  
Enjoy.

You may need a cms environment for this, otherwise you'll definitely need access to scipy, numpy, and matplotlib.

To use this package, you can just run  
`python3 python/bw_conv_cb.py`  
to see the program run on the test data.

To integrate into other places just add fit.py to your program, maybe remove the plotting/error determination for some increased speed.
Should be pretty simple.  
If you have questions feel free to ask.
