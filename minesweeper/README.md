# Minesweeper

A little python package to generate a random minesweeper board, and then solve it.
Attempting to guess is pretty hard to put into code, so right now this algorithm has the following performance:
    - Expert (16x30 w/ 99): 10% win rate
    - Intermediate (16x16 w/ 40): 47% win rate
    - Easy (9x9 w/ 10): 70% win rate

True guesses come up way more often than you might think.
