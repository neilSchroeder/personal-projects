# Tools

This is a repository of both personal and work-related projects I've put together over the years.

    
    sudoku_solver:
        A python program for quickly solving sudoku puzzles using backtracking.

    shortest_path_stargate:
        A python program for quickly finding the shortest path between two points on a board with constraints using a directed breath first search.

    find24:
        A python program for very quickly finding a combination of operations on 4 numbers such that the outcome is 24.

    flou:
        A python program to find the solution to any board in the game Flou.
    
    bw_conv_cb:
        A python program for fitting a Breit-Wigner distribution convoluted with a Crystal Ball distribution. 

    public_html:
        A php/css program for setting up a public webpage which displays plots from a linux file system (https://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~schr1077/)

    misc:
        Some miscellaneous python scripts that do fun things:
        - password_generator.py: generates a random passphrase/password with varying strengths
        - fizzbuzz.py: takes in an integer from the user and prints all fizzbuzz up to and including the integer. 
        - estimate_pi_mc.py: takes in an integer from the user and uses it to estimate pi using the monte-carlo approach.

## To Do:

    - pep8 formatting for find24
