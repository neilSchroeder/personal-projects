# Shortest Path

Here's a shortest path algorithm I wrote. On the first go around I wrote a depth
first search because I had just written the sudoku algorithm and thought I could
tweak it a bit to work here. I succeeded, but it's too slow, so I am now working
on a breadth first search. This is, again, a solution to a
[prompt on codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59669eba1b229e32a300001a/train/python).
